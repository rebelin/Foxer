# Foxer

Frogger-inspired game in Alice


## Gameplay
Use the arrow keys to move the fox around obstacles to the other side and catch the bird (using the space bar). You have 3 lives and plus or minus 60 seconds (hitting a clock will give you 10 more seconds) to finish.

## Challenges in development/Future improvements:
It was hard to code the “cause and effect” parts of the program, specifically ones involving collision.
Eventually, I want to make the game more complicated (to finish). 
For example, once you catch the bird, you must go back to where you first started with the bird. (I tried to make this happen, but I didn’t know if I had to code programs for the bird and for both the bird and the fox. There were complications with the bird and fox’s interactions.)
